Description
This is a Pokémon game where player can battle and catch wild Pokémon. There are two modes of the game: regular mode and maze mode. 

For regular mode, you can walk around to battle and catch Pokémon. While walking around, you can purchase items in the store with ‘money’. Items in the store include Ultra Ball, Poké Ball, Master Ball, Full Restore, Paralyze, Poison. The description of each item is explained in the store when you are purchasing. During battles, you can either choose to use a regular move or use the items you have purchased. There is also a “cheat” move where you will sacrifice 10% of your Pokémon HP in exchange of the most damaging move against your opponent.

For maze mode, there are three different levels: easy, intermediate, and hard. The goal is for the player to go from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. You will encounter wild Pokémon on your way. You have to battle them in order move on. Harder level will have more complicated path. The maze is randomly generated by backtracking.

Player have exp, level, money, characters, and inventory. They will earn exp if they win against a battle and increase their available characters if they successfully catch the defeated Pokémon. Inventory keeps track of the items you purchase. You will be able to level up, and your Pokémon characters will be able to acquire more moves respectively.

You will also be able to save your progress at the end of the game by pressing ‘s’. Similarly, you can retrieve your progress by entering the same username you last used. We will store you exp, level, money, characters, and inventory.
